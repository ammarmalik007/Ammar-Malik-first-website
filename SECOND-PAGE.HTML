                In Kotli, like many other areas, hospitals may face significant challenges due to limited resources, .
                inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. Patients may experience long 
                waiting times, overcrowded facilities, and a lack of essential medical equipment and supplies. 
                These conditions can severely impact the quality of care provided to patients and contribute to 
                preventable health complications.

            <p2>
                Furthermore, the geographical remoteness of Kotli and its surrounding areas may pose logistical 
                challenges in accessing specialized medical services and emergency care. Patients from rural or remote 
                communities may have to travel long distances to reach the nearest hospital, which can exacerbate health
                 disparities and delay timely treatment. Additionally, limited transportation options and poor road infrastructure 
                 can further hinder access to healthcare services.

            <p3>
                The worst conditions of hospitals in Kotli could also be compounded by systemic issues such as inadequate funding,
                 bureaucratic inefficiencies, and governance failures. Without sufficient financial support and effective management,
                  hospitals may struggle to maintain basic standards of hygiene, sanitation, and patient safety. Moreover, political
                   instability and security concerns in the region may further disrupt healthcare delivery and impede efforts to 
                   improve hospital conditions.

                Addressing the worst conditions of hospitals in Kotli and similar areas requires a comprehensive approach involving 
                government intervention, community engagement, and collaboration with healthcare stakeholders. Investments in
                 healthcare infrastructure, training programs for medical professionals, and initiatives to strengthen healthcare 
                 systems are essential to ensure that hospitals can provide high-quality care to all residents, regardless of their
                  socio-economic status or geographical location.
